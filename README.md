Amazon Video Game Reviews
For this assignment, youâ€™ll use your knowledge of Spark and of how to write functions to determine the total number of video game reviews from each customer. You'll then filter the original Spark DataFrame to determine the number of 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, and 5-star video game reviews from each customer.
